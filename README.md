# Distributed storage and parallel computing

### Idea
The idea is to use the storage capability and the computational power of a computer to solve a computation.

## Part 1
The data file will be encrypted and divided into chunks of data. All the data will be distributed over the network.

The network will act as a storage to the client.

## Part 2
The data files over the network can also be computed using distributed computing.

The computed result will be transferred over the network to the client.
